## Project
Build a pipelined, generic synchronous sequential system controlled by a finite-state machine (FSM) for image processing of binary images. The image to be processed is a .mif file containing 1 bit for each pixel in a 256x128 binary image, pre-processed in Octave. Our objective is to visualize this image in a computer monitor via VGA port.
